In the name of the Father, and of Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Dearest Holy Mother,
Most Holy Mary, 
you undo the knots that sffocate your children. 
Extend your merciful hands to me. 
I entrust to You today, 
this not <mention knot> 
and all the negative consequences that it provokes in my life.

Mary, Undoer of Kots, pray for me.

Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love,
Mother who never refuses to come to the aid of a child in need,
Mother whose hands never cease to serve your beloved children 
because they are moved by the divine love and immense mercy that exist in your heart,
cast your compassionate eyes upon me 
and see the snarl of knots that exists in my life.
You know very wekk how desperate I am,
my pain, and how I am bound by these knots.
Mary, Mother to whom God entrusted the undoing of the knots in the lives of His childrem,
I entrust into your hands the ribbon of my life.
No one, not even the evil one himself, can take it away from your precious care.
In your hands there is no knot that cannot be undone.
Powerful Mother, by your grace and intercessory power with Your Son and My Liberator, Jesus, take into your hands today this knot.

[Mention your request]

I beg you to undo it for the glory of God, once for all.

O my Lady, you are the consolation that God gives me,
the fortification of my feeble strength,
the enrichment of my destination,
and through the power if Christ, the fredom from my chains.
Hear my pleas.
Keep me, 
guide me,
protect me,
o safe refuge!

Mary Undoer of Knots pray for me.
Amen.
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
